# Traffic Volume Prediction with MLPRegressor

This project involves predicting traffic volume using the MLPRegressor (Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor) from Scikit-Learn. The code covers data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and prediction for traffic conditions.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict traffic volume based on weather conditions, holidays, and time-related features. The model used is a neural network regressor (MLPRegressor), trained on historical traffic data.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or copy the code to your local environment.
2. Ensure all required packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas seaborn matplotlib
   ```
3. Place your traffic data in the `static/` directory. Ensure it's in CSV format and named `Train.csv`.

## Usage
To run the code and see predictions, follow these steps:
1. Execute the script in a Python environment.
2. The code will:
   - Load and preprocess the traffic data.
   - Generate feature engineering for time-related attributes.
   - Scale the data using MinMaxScaler.
   - Train an MLPRegressor on the processed data.
   - Provide traffic predictions and evaluate model performance.
3. Review the output to understand traffic trends and predictions.

## Expected Outputs
When the code is executed, it will produce:
- Plots showing traffic trends by month, weekday, hour, etc.
- Predictions for the first few data points, comparing actual and predicted traffic volumes.
- A prediction for a given input, indicating the level of traffic (No Traffic, Busy, Heavy, or Worst Case).
- Mean Absolute Error for the test set, indicating the model's accuracy.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes and commit them.
3. Create a pull request, describing your changes.
